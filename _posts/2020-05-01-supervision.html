<h1>Musings on student supervision</h1>

<p>
At the NYRIA meeting in Leiden in 2018, I had the ‘brilliant’ idea to give a talk on 
student-supervisor relations. Now, this is a complex topic, which I’m really not qualified 
to speak about, particularly as I’ve had no formal training, but as a new supervisor I really 
wanted to discuss it with other people.  It turned out to be a brilliant idea; if you want to 
learn about how to supervise people, ask the people who are being supervised about their 
relationship with their supervisor and how it could be improved. For the rest that follows here, 
these are my opinions, formed from my supervision experience, from presenting that talk and chatting 
to the attendees at the meeting. If you want a more solid scientific basis, a really nice place to 
start is (see footnote). The main message I got from it is the supervisor student relationship can 
seriously influence a PhD. <br>
