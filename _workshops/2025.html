It is our pleasure to announce the in-person NYRIA Workshop 2025! 
We will celebrate NYRIA's 10th aniversary by returning to Heidelberg, where the
first workshop was held in 2015. The workshop will take place from the 22nd to 26th September 2025.
</p>

<p> 
The workshop is designed to encourage early career researchers, 
(i.e. masters students to senior postdocs) working in <b>ground-based, visible 
and infrared instrumentation</b> for astronomy to engage with each other in a 
friendly environment. Attendees will have the opportunity to present their 
work, network with peers, and develop collaborations with other participants 
from institutes around the world. The workshop will include a series of talks 
from each participant in addition to a few talks from invited speakers, a tour 
of local astronomical facilities, and a hackathon in which participants will work 
together to solve an instrumentation-themed problem.
</p>

<p>
The application fee includes the full program, four nights of accommodation, transportation from the accommodation to the venue, lunch for three days, a workshop dinner and tea and coffee breaks
